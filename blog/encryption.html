<p>we were tasked to “develop a functional solution that demonstrates
the hardware-enabled root of trust.” basically, we needed to create a
method to ensure that the authentication request for uidai app-based
face authentication comes from a trusted source and ensure that the data
doesn’t get breached unlawfully by anyone. they were currently using a
network call for encryption (wtf), so we had to implement on-device
encryption for the same.</p>
<p>for this, we built a cross-platform app that could do all that, and
as an added bonus, we demonstrated the loopholes we found in their
current infrastructure and what could be done to prevent attackers from
getting unauthorized access. a few quirks were that we had to generate
keys that are unique to the user’s smartphone. also, everything <em>had
to be on device</em> - not a single network call. we used technologies
like ecc for asymmetric cryptography, other goodies like aes, and our
solution as a whole had so many quirks it was hilarious.</p>
<p>we built the entire infrastructure, cross-platform apps, system,
testing, demo, penetration testing, network testing - all in 5 days.</p>
<p>during this project, i spammed claude for help with everything from
learning how to set up emulators on my macbook, understanding how ecc
works, to figuring out how to break into the current system and how
fail-safe our proposed system was.</p>
<p>to summarize, i would recommend learning how to learn and how to use
these large transformers - they enable learning quickly and fast,
cutting down on the bs to get to the finish line faster. i would not be
able to learn and do so much in such a short time, but i was able to
thanks to claude sonnet 3.5 (new) for teaching me and qwq 32b for
writing all the code</p>
