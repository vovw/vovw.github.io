<h1 id="the-future-go-build-it-">the future? Go build it!</h1>
<p>In recent times, rapidly evolving technology has created opportunities for people to build solutions and create companies that will leave a mark on the future. These opportunities are more abundant than they ever were. These companies hold the potential to accelerate humanity&#39;s progress by decades if not centuries, and to improve human lives by a hundredfold.</p>
<p>Working on these problems may let you witness something extraordinary in your lifetimeâ€”something people have been dreaming about for centuries and have been trying to build for decades.</p>
<p>And missing the chance to be part of something so magical is something I cannot afford to miss.</p>
<p>There are numerous hard problems to work on. If solved, they can drastically change the future of human civilization. Super-smart people are working on problems like autonomous vehicles, robots, quantum computing, space tech, etc. They need all the help they can get from <strong>you</strong> to build it.</p>
<p>If all these reasons don&#39;t excite you, then consider the fact that you only get a <strong>few</strong> <strong>chances</strong> to work on really big projects in your lifetime. So, would you rather waste it on another B2B SaaS or invent zero-carbon aviation fuel, which can fundamentally transform aviation on a massive scale and accelerate humanity by a hundredfold?</p>
<p>There are some really great problems to work on.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenAI/Meta, Mistral)</li>
<li>Autonomous cars (comma, Tesla, Rivian)</li>
<li>Space tech (SpaceX, Astranis, and many more)</li>
<li>AR (Meta, Apple)</li>
<li>Quantum computing (IBM, MCS, Google)</li>
<li>Robotics (Boston Dynamics, Anduril, Zipline, Uber, Tesla, Orangewoodlabs)</li>
<li>Biotech labs</li>
<li>Nuclear energy!!!</li>
<li>Artificial wombs!!</li>
<li>Many manufacturing problems (atomic printing, compact everything)</li>
<li>Space applications</li>
<li>BETTER transport (flying cars, drones, electric flight that doesn&#39;t suck)</li>
<li>BETTER energy solutions (solar arrays, fusion, synthetic fuel, superconductors)</li>
<li>Time travel!!</li>
</ul>
<p>.... the list goes on and
These are just the tip of the list. Just think of something hard that doesn&#39;t exist yet. Does it excite you? If yes, go build it!</p>
