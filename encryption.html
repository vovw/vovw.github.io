                                        <p>We were tasked to “develop a
                                        functional solution that
                                        demonstrates the
                                        hardware-enabled root of trust.”
                                        Basically, we needed to create a
                                        method to ensure that the
                                        authentication request for UIDAI
                                        app-based face authentication
                                        comes from a trusted source and
                                        ensure that the data doesn’t get
                                        breached unlawfully by anyone.
                                        They were currently using a
                                        network call for encryption
                                        (wtf), so we had to implement
                                        on-device encryption for the
                                        same.</p>
                                        <h2 id="our-solution">Our
                                        Solution</h2>
                                        <p>For this, we built a
                                        cross-platform app that could do
                                        all that, and as an added bonus,
                                        we demonstrated the loopholes we
                                        found in their current
                                        infrastructure and what could be
                                        done to prevent attackers from
                                        getting unauthorized access.</p>
                                        <p>A few technical challenges we
                                        had to solve: - Generate
                                        cryptographic keys that are
                                        unique to the user’s smartphone
                                        - Everything <em>had to be on
                                        device</em> - not a single
                                        network call - Implement ECC
                                        (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
                                        for asymmetric cryptography -
                                        Use AES for secure symmetric
                                        encryption - Ensure the solution
                                        was robust against various
                                        attack vectors</p>
                                        <p>We built the entire
                                        infrastructure, cross-platform
                                        apps, system, testing, demo,
                                        penetration testing, and network
                                        testing - all in 5 days.</p>

                                        <p>During this project, I used
                                        Claude extensively for help with
                                        everything from: - Setting up
                                        emulators on my MacBook -
                                        Understanding how ECC works in
                                        detail - Figuring out how to
                                        identify vulnerabilities in the
                                        current system - Testing how
                                        fail-safe our proposed system
                                        was</p>

                                        <p>To summarize, I would
                                        recommend learning how to learn
                                        and how to effectively use large
                                        language models - they enable
                                        learning quickly and
                                        efficiently, cutting down on
                                        unnecessary steps to get to the
                                        finish line faster. I wouldn’t
                                        have been able to learn and
                                        accomplish so much in such a
                                        short time without the help of
                                        Claude Sonnet 3.5 for teaching
                                        me concepts and QWQ 32B for
                                        helping with code
                                        implementation.</p>
