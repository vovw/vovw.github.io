                                        I’ve hit a few roadblocks:</p>

                                        4 is what you get being
                                        associated with a research lab.
                                        3 of those 4 problems are
                                        solvable by just joining a lab;
                                        actually, the 4th one too if I
                                        get paid and can go full time

                                        difficult to get used to and

                                        <li>Stalk people who lead the
                                        field. Literally 70% of my
                                        baseline knowledge of a field
                                        starts by reading blogs and
                                        papers written by researchers of
                                        that field. God bless personal
                                        websites.</li>
                                        <li>Nice way to skim through a
                                        research paper:
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>What is the input and the
                                        output of the function shown in
                                        the paper?</li>
                                        <li>Ask questions to yourself
                                        about if the algo can handle
                                        hard problems. At what point
                                        does it break?</li>
                                        <li>Think about incremental
                                        improvements to existing
                                        algorithms and benchmarks.</li>
                                        <li>Constantly be thinking of
                                        harder benchmarks and new
